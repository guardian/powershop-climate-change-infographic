              <p>Putting solar panels on your roof may seem like a futile gesture when coal power stations are still pumping out greenhouse gases. But home-generated energy is expected to play a huge role in Australia’s energy future.</p>
              <p>Installations of solar panels were <a href="#">up 7%</a> capacity-wise in 2016 compared with the previous year, and by mid 2017, Australia had more than 1.73 million small-scale solar power systems.</p>
              <p>These systems made a big difference, contributing 16% of Australia’s clean energy generation and 2.8% of total power generation. And that growth in solar panels may be about to go ballistic. By 2050, up to 10 million households and small businesses are forecast to have distributed energy resources such as solar, and may be producing 30 to 45% of Australia’s power, according to the <a href="#">CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia</a>.</p>
