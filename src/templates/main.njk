              <p>Putting solar panels on your roof may seem like a futile gesture when coal power stations are still pumping out greenhouse gases. But home-generated energy is expected to play a huge role in Australia’s energy future.</p>
              <p>Installations of solar panels were <a href="#">up 7%</a> capacity-wise in 2016 compared with the previous year, and by mid 2017, Australia had more than 1.73 million small-scale solar power systems.</p>
              <p>These systems made a big difference, contributing 16% of Australia’s clean energy generation and 2.8% of total power generation. And that growth in solar panels may be about to go ballistic. By 2050, up to 10 million households and small businesses are forecast to have distributed energy resources such as solar, and may be producing 30 to 45% of Australia’s power, according to the <a href="#">CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia</a>.</p>

          <p>Well, by paying a premium for accredited GreenPower, you <a href="#">drive investment in the renewables industry</a>. When you pay for GreenPower, this doesn’t mean specially sourced renewable power is transmitted to your home (now, that would be cool), but it does mean that your electricity retailer must source an equivalent amount of GreenPower accredited renewable energy, which is then added to the grid.</p>
          <p>Your carbon footprint comes down, and renewable generators get more money for doing their renewable generating thing. A few extra dollars a month from you and me can add up to a big deal for renewables in Australia.</p>
